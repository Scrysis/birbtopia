### Description

Welcome to Birbtopia. Similar to Neopets and DragonVale(shoutout to them), here you create a birb and feed them to build a relationship with them. Admire them from afar and check their stats. 

### Installation

Type "npm install" to install React.js, Vite, Apollo, bcrypt, express, graphql, JSON Web Token, and Mongoose. Type "npm run dev"  to run the application.

### Usage

The intended usage is for those who had too much time on their hands as children and always had a mobile game in their hand. Abuse out code! We need the numbers.

### Credits

The developers that created this project are Christina Sullivan(Scrysis), Garrett Gonzales(garrettgonzo), Tor First(torfirst), Jessica Clark(jessclark1234)

### Testing

The testing that took place used Vite to see if the site was fully running, we used graphql to see if our mutations and resolvers worked.
